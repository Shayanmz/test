			I heard the above quote from Taimur in a <a href="https://www.notoverthinking.com/" target="_blank">not overthinking</a> podcast episode, and well, this website is a response to that. I used to constantly find myself doubting whether or not I should create my own website, as I had no idea what I would put on it. I realized however, that none of my other internet presences accurately reflect who I am, what I'm capable of, and what I'm up to. So I've finally decided to create this minimal platform where you'll be able to learn a little more about me and what I'm up to by clicking on the links to the left there!👈🏼
